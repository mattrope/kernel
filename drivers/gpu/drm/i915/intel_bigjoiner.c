/**
 * DOC: big joiner support
 *
 * The functions here enable use of the "big joiner" which was introduced with
 * gen11 hardware.  The big joiner allows the post-DSC output of two pipes
 * to be combined as input to a single transcoder+DDI.  This ganging of two
 * CRTCs allows us to support modes that exceed the clock or resolution
 * capabilities of a single pipe.
 *
 * Use of the big joiner must remain transparent to userspace.  When userspace
 * requests a large mode on a single CRTC, the driver will transparently
 * program the registers for a second "slave" CRTC; none of this
 * behind-the-scenes programming should be reflected in any way via the slave
 * CRTC's properties.
 *
 * The hardware limits which CRTCs may be used as master or slave for a big
 * joiner configuration.  If userspace requests a large mode that can only
 * be satisfied via the big joiner, but the potential slave CRTC is already
 * in use driving a different display, the configuration cannot be supported
 * and the atomic transaction should be rejected.  Similarly, if we successfully
 * setup a big joiner configuration, but a subsequent atomic request from
 * userspace starts trying to directly use the CRTC that i915 is using as a
 * big joiner slave, that request will have to be rejected (current platforms
 * only have a single potential slave CRTC, so there's no opportunity to
 * migrate our slave responsibilities to a different unused CRTC).
