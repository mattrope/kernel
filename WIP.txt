Work in Progress / Notes:

 * I've reversed my previous stance on whether we should allow userspace to
   request big modes on both pipes B and C or just on pipe B.  Hardware
   always considers pipe B to be the master/left side, so for an initial
   implementation it's easiest to also make it the master from the uapi
   perspective.  We can always go back and relax the restriction in the
   future if we decide it's worth the extra complexity, but let's keep the
   initial implementation as simple and easy to review as possible.

 * We now program PIPE_DSS_CTL1 with the proper bits when the big joiner is
   in use.

 * CRTC iteration order when programming CRTCs should be correct now (and
   consider slave+master as a single unit programmed together without a
   vblank in between).

 * Vblank evasion should skip the end/beginning for slave/master so that the
   evasion will extend to cover the programming of both CRTCs.

 * Still need *lots* of work to make various code look at the master's state
   when programming the slave.

 * Open:  How should we handle pipe CRC's (a single value) requested by
   userspace when we're actually using two pipes internally?

 * debugfs i915_display_info probably needs an update/clarification in general;
   the information today is a mix of how we're going to program the hardware
   (pipe stuff) and how userspace asked us to program the hardware (plane
   stuff).  HW state and UAPI state are already pretty different (e.g., NV12
   plane usage on gen11) and big joiner just breaks this further.
